list of materials:

Arduino Nano/Uno x2
NRF24L01 x2
NRF24L01 Carrier Card x2
Jumper cables


        


The circuit we will use for both the receiver and the transmitter is the same. 
We specify the receiver or transmitter status of the modules in the codes.

NRF24L01	      Arduino Uno/Nano
VCC	            5V 
GND	            GND
CS	            10
CE	            9
MOSI	          11
MISO	          12
SCK	            13


  
Since SCK, MISO and MOSI pins are related to SPI communication, they may differ according to the Arduino type.
Therefore, do not forget to take a look at this table while installing the circuit.

                MOSI	  MISO	    SCK
Arduino Uno	     11	     12	      13
Arduino Nano	   11	     12	      13
Arduino Mega	   51	     50	      52
